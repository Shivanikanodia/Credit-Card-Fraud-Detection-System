# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical data. Fraud detection is critical for minimizing financial loss and protecting customer trust.

## Business Problem

Credit card fraud can result in significant financial and reputational damage. The objective is to flag fraudulent transactions accurately while minimizing false positives, enabling banks to act quickly and efficiently.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Records**: 786,363 transactions
- **Features**: 28 anonymized numerical features and target label `Class` (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)

## Approach

1. **EDA & Visualization**: Understand transaction patterns, reversals, and merchant behavior
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data Description, data cleaning and data visualization
   - Data Quality and accuracy  
3. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - Focus on Recall to reduce missed fraud cases

## Key Insights

- Certain accounts and merchants (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Alibaba) show high reversal patterns
- Fraud often follows multi-swipe or reversed transactions
- Class imbalance is severe (<0.2% fraud), requiring careful handling

## Limitations

- Only 2 days of data; lacks seasonal/long-term patterns
  
## Tech Stack

- Python, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook, AWS S3
